# uctwifimapper

Aim

This project involved the design and development of an Android app that allows users to view the quality of Eduroam wifi in different locations on UCTâ€™s upper campus, in the form of a campus map with overlaid colour-coded wifi zones.

This prohect consist of two major components:
1. Android application
2. Server/Backend application

File Structure:
The android application is located in the frontend folder
The server/backend application is located in the backend folder

Requirements to compile and run
Android Application:
1. Android studio
2. At least java 7
3. Android sdk 28
3. Android tes device

Backend or Server application:
1. Java 7 or greater
2. Postgresql database server
3. PostGis plugin

How to run:
Android applicatio:
1. Open the application in android studio 
2. Coplile and build application to emulator
3. The application will require permissions to access location for it to work properly

Backend Server:
1. Have poatgresql intalled and running
2. Import into postgresql the file, wifimapper.sql, this will initialise the database used by the application. 


Database
- Postgress with PostGIS plugin

Architecture
- WifiMapperServer -> initialise server and listen on port 8800
- WifimapperRouter -> Process request and send processed request to correct dao implementation class
- Dao -> Interface
- AccessPointDao -> Perform database queries
- AccessPoint -> Business object, mapped to database.
-Database -> Setup singelton object for connection to db

API:
/       -> returns generic respose

/apn -> GET: returns list of accesspoints, POST: saves access point to database 

Example Queries
